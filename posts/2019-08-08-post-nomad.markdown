title: Post Nomad
---

Today is a landmark day for me. I am finishing my remote job and beginning the transition
to a non-nomadic life. In the last 18 months I have been to four continents, learnt a second
language and met more people than I could begin to count. 

I have perhaps learnt more about myself and what I truly value than I have about the
places I've visited. After such an extended period of "finding myself", I sometimes verge
on feeling guilty that I've had such an opportunity to focus on personal growth. After
spending some time in countries with less stability or prosperity, the struggles
you often see (or don't see) on the news become more human and, in a sense, more mundane as
well. If I take nothing else positive from all this, I hope I can maintain a wider
perspective and be more atuned to the things happening outside my bubble.

After such an experience, rich with freedom but also with stretches of loneliness, I feel
ready to head home and build a life in one place. Ready to settle in my home city without
temptation lingering about the other places I could be. Ready for a new challenge, to be
consumed by it even. Ready to confront and not be calcified by the immense challenges that
our generation faces, both social and environmental. Ready to strengthen old friendships
 and forge new ones. Ready to find my home again.
