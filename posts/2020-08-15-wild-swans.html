        <div><p>Communism as a concept is commonly discounted because of the tradegies that came out of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward in Communist China. These awful episodes were evidence of a dictator waging a war of indoctrination and fearmongering, not the purist idealogy of a committed communist.</p>
<p>This is not to say that communism is the answer to a broken system in western capitalist democracies, but I don’t think it is productive to discount alternative systems of thought based on a misunderstood sequence of events.</p>
<p>Communist China in the second half of the 20th century was the product of a number of factors. A traditional culture was put through multiple stresses from the Japanese occupation of WW2 to the Western-backed power that took over after the war. The working classes across China were repeatedly mistreated and starved by a rotating cast of corrupt and brutal regimes. Set against this background, a rebellion formed that overwhelmingly converted a tired populace. Their ideals of a shared national wealth were in stark contrast with the excessive wealth gap between the working class and their oppressors.</p>
<p>After a violent civil war, the communists took power and got to work recreating their system of government in the pursuit of equality. Clearly this did not create a self-sustaining communist utopia. But I think it’s worth considering what went wrong and why. Most importantly there was Mao. A dictator with no concept of how a national economy really worked, demonstrated by the policies prioritising the production of steel over crops that led to brutal famine. There was an anti-intellectual campaign to crush individual thought and replace it with a cult of unquestioning Mao followers.</p>
<p>These horrible events are well documented. What I had scarcely heard of before reading <em>Wild Swans</em> by Jung Chang were the periods of stability where living conditions were better than they had been in generations. The surrounding context was also new to me, I was unaware of the brand of nepotism that runs deeply in traditional Chinese culture and the historic disputes from decades of hardship being prosecuted in the name of communism.</p>
<p>Context is an important factor when discussing political ideas so it is troubling that we have such a one-sided view of the history of communism in China. This shouldn’t come as a surprise though really. The society we are educated in misrepresents our own colonial past in similar ways.</p>
<!-- There are some interesting parallels to the current state of modern capitalist democracies. The comfortable -->
<!-- lifestyles enjoyed by the majority of developed western nations is not likely to inspire a violent rebellion -->
<!-- but there are increasing calls for more progressive socialist policy and discontent with the actions of corrupt -->
<!-- politians and mining billionaires. -->
<p>While reading Chang’s book I was reminded more of the corrupting influence of power and the dangers of misinformation than a warning of the dangers of communism. Mao is central as a figure of pure self-interest with a singular focus on retaining power. The concept of a equitable distribution of wealth should not comdemned as a failed idea of the past because of crimes committed in its name.</p></div>
