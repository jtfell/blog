title: Wild Swans

Communism as a concept is commonly discounted because of the tradegies that came out of the Cultural Revolution
and the Great Leap Forward in Communist China. These awful episodes were evidence of a dictator waging a war of
indoctrination and fearmongering, not the purist idealogy of a committed communist. 

This is not to say that communism is the answer to a broken system in western capitalist democracies, but I don't
think it is productive to discount alternative systems of thought based on a misunderstood sequence of events.

Communist China in the second half of the 20th century was the product of a number of factors. A traditional
culture was put through multiple stresses from the Japanese occupation of WW2 to the Western-backed power that
took over after the war. The working classes across China were repeatedly mistreated and starved by a rotating
cast of corrupt and brutal regimes. Set against this background, a rebellion formed that overwhelmingly
converted a tired populace. Their ideals of a shared national wealth were in stark contrast with the excessive
wealth gap between the working class and their oppressors.

After a violent civil war, the communists took power and got to work recreating their system of government in the
pursuit of equality. Clearly this did not create a self-sustaining communist utopia. But I think it's worth
considering what went wrong and why. Most importantly there was Mao. A dictator with no concept of how a national
economy really worked, demonstrated by the policies prioritising the production of steel over crops that led to
brutal famine. There was an anti-intellectual campaign to crush individual thought and replace it with a cult
of unquestioning Mao followers.

These horrible events are well documented. What I had scarcely heard of before reading _Wild Swans_ by Jung
Chang were the periods of stability where living conditions were better than they had been in generations. The
surrounding context was also new to me, I was unaware of the brand of nepotism that runs deeply in traditional
Chinese culture and the historic disputes from decades of hardship being prosecuted in the name of communism.

Context is an important factor when discussing political ideas so it is troubling that we have such a one-sided
view of the history of communism in China. This shouldn't come as a surprise though really. The society we are
educated in misrepresents our own colonial past in similar ways.

<!-- lifestyles enjoyed by the majority of developed western nations is not likely to inspire a violent rebellion -->
<!-- but there are increasing calls for more progressive socialist policy and discontent with the actions of corrupt -->
<!-- politians and mining billionaires. -->

While reading Chang's book I was reminded more of the corrupting influence of power and the dangers of
misinformation than a warning of the dangers of communism. Mao is central as a figure of pure self-interest
with a singular focus on retaining power. The concept of a equitable distribution of wealth should not comdemned
as a failed idea of the past because of crimes committed in its name.
