title: From The Ashes

As with anything in life, there are a lot of reasons that people start software
projects.

Sometimes you want to remind yourself that not all codebases have to be as ugly
as the one at your day job.
Sometimes you want to try out that new technology your boss won't let you near.
Sometimes you don't want to build to a set of requirements.

Because they can potentionally become profitable or even useful, the success 
(or lack thereof) of software projects are often judged from a purely pragmatic
perspective. I find this absurdly reductive. Writing software can be as much an
art as writing music and yet their finished forms are viewed through an entirely
different lense.

I built my latest project using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) for a few reasons,
none of which were particularly pragmatic. Ideological would be a better description.

As our planet faces an existential threat borne out of overconsumption, many facets
of my lifestyle have shifted towards something resembling minimalism. If my shopping
travelling and eating habits are affected, why not the way I write (or think about)
software.

As software eats more and more of the world, we should be holding the programs we
interact with to a higher standard of quality and correctness. And that starts with
the foundations of the stack along with our philosophy and approach to wielding them.

These trends lead me to be bullish on the future of Rust, particularly for projects
with a high impact. I would prefer to align myself with innovative use of technology
for the betterment of the planet than collect a big paycheck for building the next
Facebook. The "Move fast and break things" mentality is how we ended up with an
environment in peril and the antidote is making things to last.
