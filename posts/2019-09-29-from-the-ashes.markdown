From The Ashes

As part of my transition from nomad to Brisbanite, I am sunsetting my little
[side-project](https://locationless.club).


As with anything in life, there are a lot of reasons that people start software
side-projects.

Sometimes..
Sometimes..

Because they can potentionally become profitable or even useful, their success
(or lack thereof) are often judged from a purely pragmatic perspective. I find
this absurdly reductive. Writing software can be as much an art as writing
music and yet their finished forms are viewed through an entirely different lense.

I built my side-project using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) for a few reasons,
none of which were particularly pragmatic. Ideological would be a better description.

As our planet faces an existential threat borne out of overconsumption, many facets
of my lifestyle have shifted towards something resembling minimalism. If my shopping
travelling and eating habits are affected, why not the way I write (or think about)
software. As software eats more and more of the world, I think we should be more








Of course there is a time for making pragmatic choices in writing software. That
is why I have built my career up to now using Nodejs and Postgres for web backends.
They are well-understood technologies which enable me to get the job done
efficiently and to meet the requirements of the job.
