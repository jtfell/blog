title: Capitalism's sharp teeth
---

Technology has facilitated many positive changes in our society and has the
potential to provide countless more. It is also feared. And rightfully so,
as it has been wielded by captialism in exponentially scary ways.

For decades, capitalism has focused our society on creating ever more growth and
wealth. Despite some imperfections, it's hard to argue that the core ideas behind
capitalism haven't been felt as a net benefit. The "growth at all costs" mindset
at the heart of capitalism has been a driving force in businesses harnessing technology
to create efficiencies, solve hard problems and enrich the world.

But the goals of past decades shouldn't be the top priority when designing how
our society operates. The biggest problems of the start of the 21st century are
centered around environmental sustainability and the gulf between the rich and
poor, and a focus on growth on alone will not solve them. We need to re-prioritise.

The unquenchable thirst for growth in companies is reared in them by their capitalist
environment, but recently the inherent scalabilty of technology and software allows the
big ones to consolidate their position of dominance. In the past, large profitable
companies required large numbers of staff to run their operation. With this
constraint lifted, the profit for shareholders has ever increased while workers increasing
lose their jobs.

Capitalism has quietly developed into a threatening monster. It has claws, grown of
executives and investors protecting their status and wealth. And big sharp teeth,
paid for by decades of lobbying and corruption. And it has meltingly-hot firey breath,
manufactured with modern technolgy.

We need to recognise that the current state of technology in our society is not
most efficiently governed by capitalism and our current legal frameworks. It
can be seen in the ability of big tech companies to exploit tax loopholes
and the repeatted comittal of antitrust violations that our goverments are
ill-equipped to regulate technology companies. This is symptomatic of an
insufficient framework for getting the most out of technology for everyone on
this planet.
