        <h2 class="h2 caps">Finding Purpose</h2>
        <div><p>I have been asking myself recently whether I still have a passion for software development and it’s a hard question to answer. In some respects I love it. I’m deeply fascinated with complex software systems and the social processes that we build around the creation of them. On the other hand, I have been becoming increasingly cogniscent of the inequality in our world and with that has come a sense that I need to be using my privilege and education to make a difference.</p>
<p>I know I won’t change the world in an outsized way. Human societies have been unequal since the dawn of time and still today politics are undermined by corruption and self-interest. I don’t have the charisma or background to be a force for change in the political arena so I need to accept that social change in a wealthy, comfortable society will be slow.</p>
<p>With this acceptance comes a need to reframe my personal goals for finding purpose in my career. There is a balance to be found here which is difficult to quantify as every potential job has a different mix of problem space, culture, team size and diversity. Unfortunately, there are other factors conspiring to make this equation more complicated.</p>
<p>In the current state of our capitalist system, negative externalities like inequality and climate pollution are not penalised sufficiently. These perverse incentives skew the captial and resouces in our society towards problematic, unsustainable industries. This means that you seriously limit your opportunities for finding the right team to join when you exclusively consider jobs at business that you consider ethical.</p>
<p>These compromises can be hard to swallow and make it difficult to evalutate each option effectively. Let’s think about it in a more concrete way. Would you prefer:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>A boring role in a company with a vision that you are excited about</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>An intellectually stimulating problem space which operates in a business-as-usual industry</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s complicate it further. Your initial choice out of (A) and (B) seems to have a 20% worse team culture than the alternative after you interview with them. Which do you pick now? This process of point scoring along different axes continues across a range of factors. And while you are making these judgements based on the imperfect information that you have gleaned through an interview process where you have needed to be constantly aware of the impression you are making on them.</p></div>
