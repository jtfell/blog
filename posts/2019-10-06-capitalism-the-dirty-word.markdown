title: Capitalism, a dirty word
---

Capitalism and technology are often associated with many of the evils in our
world. But why is this exactly? Technology has facilitated many positive changes
in our society, and has the potential to provide countless more. The issue, I
believe, resides in how it is wielded by captialism.

For decades, capitalism has focused our society on creating ever more growth and
wealth. Despite some imperfections, it's hard to argue that the core ideas behind
capitalism haven't been a net benefit. The "growth at all costs" mindset at the heart of
capitalism has been a driving force in businesses harnessing technology to create efficiencies,
solve hard problems and enrich the world.

I believe these goals should no longer be the top priority when deciding how our society
operates. The biggest problems of the start of the 21st century are centered around environmental
sustainability and the gulf between the rich and poor, and a focus on growth on alone will
not solve them. We need to re-prioritise.

The unquenchable thirst for growth in companies is a byproduct of their capitalist
environment while the inherent scalabilty of technology and software is allowing tech
companies to consolidate their position of dominance. In the past, large companies
required large numbers of staff to run their operation. Without this requirement,
the profit for shareholders can increase while the workers lose their jobs.

Additionally, when the negative externalities of a businesses operations are not priced in
to their products, there is no incentive to innovate and improve the sustainability of their
processes. Without this incentive, it is difficult for leadership to make a case for investing
in improvements. Their job is, after all, to create returns on the shareholders money.
