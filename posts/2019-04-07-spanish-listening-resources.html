        <div><p>I’ve been learning Spanish for about 5 months now and have done a lot of searching for the best beginner to intermediate content for practicing listening and understanding Spanish. The most difficult part of Spanish for me is undoubtedly understanding native speakers as they speak very quickly. Finding input in your target language that is both interesting and at an appropriate difficulty level is half the battle in my experience.</p>
<p>In the spirit of sharing, here is a list of my favourite resources in order of increasing difficulty. Dreaming Spanish is an amazing resource due to their philosophy of exclusively listening to the languaage being the best way to learn. While I don’t necesarily think it’s the most efficient way to get to a conversational level, their videos are super helpful in the early stages. I combined the super-beginner and beginner level videos with <a href="https://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> (for vocabulary) then was able to branch out more as I progressed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpPf-YgbU7GbOHc3siOGQ5KmVSngZucl">Dreaming Spanish Super-Beginner</a> (Spain)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most understandable content I could find for a complete beginner. Relatively interesting topics especially under the contraints of making it understandable almost entirely through mime.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpPf-YgbU7HWrrenMs3-nuhxgzyAiA-C">Dreaming Spanish Beginner</a> (Spain)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the above, but a little more variety that is afforded by the increase in difficulty. Some of these videos are not a huge step above the super-beginner ones, but you may need to preview a few to find an easier one at first.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-dx6kd5f4E">Extra in Espanol</a> (Spain)</li>
</ul>
<p>A classic resource. A friends-style sitcom geared towards language learners. It’s pretty entertaining and is easy to follow with only basic Spanish as lots of words and phrases are repeated and everything is exaggerated. It’s quite short but I got value out of watching it through twice.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlpPf-YgbU7Gssxi9f72cZktgOb4Vpdoy">Dreaming Spanish Intermediate</a> (Spain)</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow these videos are way easier for me to understand than other content with a similar level of difficulty. I’m not sure if this is due to me being very familiar with the host by this point (I’ve watched most of his videos), or if he is very good at speaking clearly and at the ideal pace for intermediate learners.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gossipgirlacapulcocapitulos.blogspot.com/">Gossip Girl Acapulco</a> (Mexico)</li>
</ul>
<p>Embarrassingly enough, I’ve seen the the first season the US version of Gossip Girl and this follows an almost identical plot. Although some of the Mexican slang can be hard to understand at first (and their use of Spanglish is jarring sometimes), I found this to be great practice for understanding regular conversations. There is a serious lack of depth in the content of conversations so the vocabulary is very repetitive. It’s ridiculous how many times the characters greet each other, order something, talk for 1 or 2 minutes, and then leave their drinks as they race off to the next plot point! This combined with vaguely knowing the plot resulted in a noticable improvement in how well I have been able to have basic interactions at full speed with locals in Mexico. Maybe not for everyone though.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.espanolistos.com/">Espanolistos</a> (Colombia/United States)</li>
</ul>
<p>I found this a useful resource for just listening to on busses or walking around. The episodes are nice and long, the female host (from Colombia) speaks very clearly and the topics are quite varied. I particularly enjoyed them reading out parts of The Alchemist (with voices and all) and the two-parter on their love story. Some episodes can be difficult to follow but the volume of episodes makes this less of an issue. I just have a lot of them downloaded before a trip and try a few until I find one that works for me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://radialistas.net/serie-noticias-de-ultima-ira/">Noticias De Utlima Ira</a> (Cuba)</li>
</ul>
<p>An audio history of the European invasion of Latin America in short episodes in a strange mash-up of news-casts with funny voices and a narrator, I found the content really interesting and the different voices make it easier to distinguish new trains of thought. This is definitely aimed at native speakers and can be difficult to follow at times, but the content has kept me interested so its worth a try as you reach an intermediate level.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isgq4NbpHlY">La Casa De Las Flores</a> (Mexico)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only available on Netflix (I’ve just linked the trailer), but its a modern telenovela with lots of beautiful people speaking Spanish in a Mexican accent. Not particularly easy to understand but it follows a familiar format and plot to any soap opera in English.</p></div>
