        <h2 class="h2 caps">Bull and Lamb</h2>
        <div><p>Today my team started prototyping an implementation for a core part of the product using a technology that doesnâ€™t support Javascript (our primary language). This is really the only time I would consider a new language, as I am a strong believer in the value in keeping your technical footprint small.</p>
<p>Lets say the options were Language Lamb Lang (brb, trade-marking) and Bull Lang. Our team has a little experience in Lamb and none in Bull. After doing some reading and experimentation I came to the conclusion that Bull would be the better technical decision for the project while Lamb would be easier to hire for and had some support from others on the team.</p>
<p>This a common scenario and I wonder how this decision should really be made. Should we take on the risk of being technologically unexceptional (weird consideration for a tech business) or the hiring and upskilling risk?</p>
<p>It is 100% possible that we will be grappling with an untethered Bull, unable to wield its power and petrifying new hires. But is that better than being stuck with an uncomplicated Lamb, familiar and easy to tame but utterly unexceptional?</p>
<p>I am the kind of person that wants to grapple with the Bull, fully expecting to bend it to my will. That is the thrill of coding for me. Initial confusion replaced by clarity, allowing me to impose order and elegantly solve the problem. The final evidence of my victory over disorder evidenced in a set of text files, committed into history forever.</p>
<p>Work should be about finding satisfaction but also has to result in something maintainable. Maintainability is not just about clean, well-abstracted code. It has a dimension along comprehensibility as well. How well other people can understand and extend the code you have written is a function of both their (predicted) familiarity with the language and the objective complexity of the code itself.</p>
<p>I have the complication of being potentially the most active in the new codebase, but also have incentives to want the company to be sucessful. My selfish desire to feel powerful when working on this project will colour my interpretation of the types of risk inherent in the decision that I objectively understand. The abilities of an abstract pool unknown potential hires is hard to accurately predict. Maybe in three years time Scala will come into vogue and suddenly be easy to hire for. Maybe there is (as I suspect) a valuable filtering of potential hires who stick to mainstream languages that improves your chances of hiring someone talented.</p>
<p>Ultimately I need to be able to make the case for Bull or Lamb without personal bias. This dictates that I only consider the facts, but my judgement as the domain expert will be taken into account. I guess I have a conflict of interest.</p></div>
